\section{Introduction}
\linn{To add comments in the text easily} \liya{double click me to go to the code and see how to use your named command} \jonathan{you can change the colors at the top} Background of the study. Why do you want to study this
problem. Why this problem is important or interesting? Etc.
What has been done about this problem? What do you want
to achieve? What is the uniqueness or the contribution of your
study? Etc.
Brief what is your study and report organization. Provide
the link to your code


\section{Materials and Methods}

\subsection{Data explanation and characterization}
What data are you using? where the data come from, data
type, data size, data range , etc

\subsection{Data preprocessing}
What you did on quality check, data clearing, data selection
or data transformation, etc.

\subsection{Data analysis/mining}
Methods/algorithms used for your study.

\subsection{Evalution and interprations}
Metrics used for evaluation such as confusion table,
significance level. Validation methods used such as cross
validation, independent test.

\section{Results}
Present your results. Here you can use tables and figures to
clearly show the results, which matches the analyses step-by
step


\begin{figure}[H] %H places the figure exactly where it is in the code, otherwise overleaf positions it automatically
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{IEEE-conference-template-062824/fig1.png}
    \caption{Example of a figure caption.}
    \label{examplefig}
\end{figure}

Using H on the figure lets me add writing below when it usually would automatically be moved below the other paragraph due to it having space. 

\begin{table}[H]
\caption{Caption of the table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Table}&\multicolumn{3}{|c|}{\textbf{Table Column Head}} \\
\cline{2-4} 
\textbf{Head} & \textbf{\textit{Table column subhead}}& \textbf{\textit{Subhead}}& \textbf{\textit{Subhead}} \\
\hline
copy& More table copy$^{\mathrm{a}}$& &  \\
\hline
\multicolumn{4}{l}{$^{\mathrm{a}}$Sample of a Table footnote.}
\end{tabular}
\label{tab1}
\end{center}
\end{table}

Same goes for the table.

\section{Discussion and Conclusion}
Regarding the results you get, what are your understanding of
them, for example , the model is surprisingly good or bad, and
why; the results are as expected or not in terms relation,
important features, etc.
From the results, what you have learned and you want to let
your readers know.
Any limitation of your study, what further works can be done
to improve.
Overall summary of our study
